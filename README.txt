- Features -

* Spawn kits: (Obviously) Able to set a kit players get every time they spawn (With or without cooldown). 
	Or....

* Profession Mode: Randomized kits based on a spawn chance configurable in the settings xml file. Created to
	give servers a bit more realistic feel. Giving players the impression that their characters did something
	before the apocalypse other than standing naked on a beach...
	
* Subscription Mode: Think classes. Players can use the commands 'sk list' and 'sk class className' to pick
	a kit (Or class. If you think of it that way) that they will get every time they spawn. Useful in 
	deathmatch like scenarios.
	
* Live Configuration Modifications: All settings (Other than kit definitions) can be modified in game using
	the 'sk set <option> <argument>' command. Turn modes on and off, enable or disable cooldown, etc..
